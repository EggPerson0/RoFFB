# üèéÔ∏è RoFFB

**RoFFB** is a Windows **.NET** application that uses [ViGEm](https://vigem.org/) and [DirectInput](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee417001(v=vs.85)) to connect **Force Feedback racing wheels** and related peripherals to **Roblox**.  
It bridges the gap between professional-grade racing hardware and Roblox games, enabling realistic **force feedback**, pedal inputs, and more.

---

## üìñ Overview

RoFFB allows you to:
- Detect and connect DirectInput-compatible racing wheels, pedals, and other controllers.
- Emulate an Xbox 360 controller using ViGEm for Roblox compatibility.
- Translate real-time **Force Feedback** effects from Roblox into physical feedback on your wheel.
- Customize input mapping and tuning for your specific hardware.

This makes it possible to experience **true simulation-style racing** inside Roblox.
